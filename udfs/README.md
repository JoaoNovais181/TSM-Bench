# User Defined Functions (UDFs)

We have also implemented additional time series tasks using **User Defined Functions (UDFs)**. The implemented queries involve a mix of matrix operations and iterative procedures, which are very hard to implement in the native language. We consider the following tasks: 

1. Similarity Search
2. Time Series Representation
3. Matrix Decomposition
4. Recovery of Missing Values
5. Clustering, Classification
6. Anomaly Detection.

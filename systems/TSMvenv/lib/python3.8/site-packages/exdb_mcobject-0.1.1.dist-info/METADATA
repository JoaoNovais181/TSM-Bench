eXtremeDB python interface

This module implements eXtremeDB python interface.
The eXtremeDB in-memory and persistent database management system is McObjectâ€™s core product. Exceptionally fast, with unparalleled flexibility, eXtremeDB is a powerful tool for the professional developer.

```
import exdb

schema = '''
#define uint4     unsigned<4>

declare database opendb;

class Class1  {
    uint4 i4;
};
'''

exdb.init_runtime()

# Parse schema, load dictionary and create python dictionary object
dict = exdb.load_dictionary(schema)

# Open (create) database with default parameters
db = exdb.open_database(dbname='opendb', dictionary=dict, db_segment_size=128*1024*1024)

with db.connect() as conn:
    conn.startTransaction()
    o = conn.new("Class1")
    o.i4 = 42
    conn.commit()

db.close()
```

# Description

This is python interface to eXtremeDB runtime. It allows access to all eXtremeDB runtime feaures including class API, embedded SQL engine, creation and connection to remote and distributed SQL engines. This module supports all eXtremeDB embedded class-level datatypes and SQL datatypes, including arrays, vectors, structs, sequences. It supports all eXtremeDB additional modules, i.e. High Availability, Cluster, IoT, etc.

This package includes module for extending eXtremeDB SQL in python using User Defined Functions (UDF).

This module works on all platforms supported by eXtremeDB, of course if this platform is supported by python itself. 

It supports mcobject's object based API for database access as well as python DB API specification PEP 249 for SQL access, both in-process/shared memory local and networked remote access.
